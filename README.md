Made an attempt to Create a Movie Name Guess With Emoojis

when player clicks on start game it asks him for his willingness like whether he is ready to start the game or not
If yes, it asks for the nick name and then it gives ok button

after clicking on okay button then it will give an popup fot the instructions

when we press continue button it starts the game 

for every guess you will have a time to guess each emoji

By seeing emojis player trys to guess the movie name
if player score increases then the guess is right and if player guesses wrong then the game gets terminated then and there
the whole game runs with some background music

While The game ends it will display some random phrases for the player based on their score gained.

TechStack: vanilla HTML,CSS and JavaScript
